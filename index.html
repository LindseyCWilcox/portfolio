    <h3>Live Our Stories</h3>
    <p>If you're looking for the hows, whens, and wheres of travel, then this site might not be for you. If you're looking for the whos, the what ifs, the colors, and smells of places and people you may never meet, then this might be a site for you. We are storytellers, tale-weavers, and feeling-inducers. The hows and wheres are details in the larger journey, and like traveling merchants of years past, we bring you our stories of footprints across the globe.</p> 
    <p>These stories are meant to be read as you please. There is no correct order nor chronology. You may find interest reading by continent, or by disparate region, travelling the globe with our words. You can read by content, by country, by theme, or by voice. These stories are meant to give you a glimpse, albeit brief, of a life lived elsewhere. For navigation's sake, the stories are organized by continent, though there is no way "best" way to read these tales. Any one way is as good as any other. Our readers shape us and we have contributors across the globe, for which we are thankful.</p>

    <h3>Live Your Story</h3>
    <p>Send us your thoughts, tales, stories, and places. We'd love to share and blend them within our world and, of course, credit our contributors. One person cannot possibly experience the entire world, but it is our goal to bring together experiences, tastes, and ideas around our global table for sharing, growing, and inspiring.</p>
