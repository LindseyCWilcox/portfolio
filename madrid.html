      <p>So you've decided to take a trip to Spain. !Fantastico! Here are a few tips to help you make the most of your trip.</p>
      
      <section>
        <h2>First Things First. Let's Talk Travel Logistics.</h2>
        <h3>Getting There</h3>
          <p>Depending on where you're starting in the USA, the trip across the Atlantic will take anywhere between 8 and 16 hours. Add in the 6 to 9 hour time change you'll experience when you land and you miss nearly a day in traveling. A few airlines have really terrific deals heading east and make the flight a bit more enjoyable (if you're not able to sleep the duration). I recommend KLM, Delta, and Lufthansa if you're able to jump on one of their flights. Their customer service is top-notch, rare for an airline, and flights are comfortable without requiring a hefty first-class price tag.</p> 
        <h4>West Coast Travelers</h4>  
          <p>From the West Coast, Delta runs a great flight over the Northern part of Canada direct from Seattle to Schipol Airport in Amsterdam. From there, it's another 3 hour flight south and you're there!</p>
        <h4>East Coast Travelers</h4>
          <P>If you find yourself on the East Coast, you have a few more options. JFK and Washington-Dulles have non-stop flights to Madrid that will have you on the ground in Europe in just over 7 hours. Flights from Miami are a bit longer, coming in at roughly 8 and a half hours, wind dependant.</P>
        <h3>Arriving in Madrid</h3>
          <p>When you step off the plane, be prepared to arrive in a different world. You'll hear countless languages around you and realize that your American Dollars won't do much for you that side of the Atlantic. If you forgot to change your currency prior to your trip, change just enough at the aiport to get you to your hotel. The exchange rates at Barajas, or any airport, are not competitive. Wait until you get to a real bank in the city to change the majority of your currency.</p>
        <h3>Finding Your Hotel</h3>
