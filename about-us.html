    <h3>Who We Are</h3>
    <p>We are storytellers. We are movers. We are livers and doers and readers and writers. We believe traveling should be a self-experienced event, not something you copy from a book or a blog or a TV show. These are our stories, each independent and self-standing like the many places we visit, yet much more powerful in unison. We travel to live and see, do and learn, write and be. We don't believe travelling is the culination of selfies, flights logged, and tours booked, but rather the sum of your experience seeing, feeling, doing, and ultimately, being. That is the goal. Not to go abroad, but to be a traveller and return with a story. You choose to share if you like.</p>
    <p>We are crafted by our contributors, the storytellers and storyreaders. We are crafted by the world around us. The places, people, tastes, sights. We serve as a forum, a campfire, a dinner table. If you're here to read, terrific. If you're here to share, terrific. We're happy to have you all the same and hope that our stories inspire you to be somewhere. Enjoy. - The TT.</p>
